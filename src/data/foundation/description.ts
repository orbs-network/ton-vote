  en: "TON Foundation has noticed a new initiative gaining momentum in the TON community. This initiative, known as the TON Believers Fund, has garnered notable support after composing an [Open Letter](https://t.me/SighToNews/690) to the TON Foundation through their Telegram channel. This initiative was simultaneously supported by a consortium of 11 TON communities in 9 languages that has over 300,000 community members.\n\nSeveral notable projects have already supported the fund, including major ecosystem investors [First Stage Labs](https://t.me/first_stage_labs/146), [DWF](https://x.com/dwflabs?s=11&t=KmCtPLRHBvIqlxKkkNJqhA), [Kilo Fund](https://t.me/Tonnypowerbewithyou/519), [ConnecTON](https://t.me/ConnectonVPN/111), and Layer 3 solution and creators of Ton.Vote - [Orbs](https://t.me/tonlicious/831). Between them, they have already donated 90,000 TON into the incentives pool.\n\nTON Believers Fund (TBF) believes an issue prevents the ecosystem from reaching its full potential. Namely, TON supply centralization with large holders, and therefore liquidation risk - if those miners were to sell en masse. The TON Believers Fund has created [a smart contract](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/locker-contract) that they believe can help to solve this issue, by incentivizing large holders with a fixed yield to lock their TON for 5 years.\n\n**The smart contract works in 2 ways:** \n\n1.  Anyone can deposit to the contract, which locks TON for 5 years. 2 years locked and 3 years of vesting monthly.\n\n2.  Anyone can donate to the contract, which is then used as a reward yield for those who lock their TON.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the community sentiment toward TBF, and the contract code. TON Foundation is excited to see such a well-thought-out community initiative. We have contacted the team behind the fund and are considering supporting them. However, after consulting with the Orbs team and considering we would donate funds from the reserve, we believe it should be put to a community vote.\n\nThe idea is simple - incentivize large holders to lock up supply for 5 years.\n\n**Depending on how successful TBF is, it would contribute to:**\n\n1.  Bringing certainty to Toncoin tokenomics\n\n2.  Demonstrating to the community the commitment of large holders\n\n3.  Contributing toward TON ecosystem Total Value Locked (TVL)\n\n**TBF has requested our support in 3 areas:**\n\n-   Donating TON from the treasury to match the staking yield for 5 years\n\n-   Recruiting early miners to deposit\n\n-   Publicity support to attract more community members and projects to help\n\nAfter discussing with TBF, we believe that matching the staking yield for 5 years would be far too large a position for TON Foundation to take. For the initiative to be successful, community members should also donate to the incentives side.\n\n**TON Foundation is prepared to offer them the following, depending on the communities decision:**\n\n-   Donation of 1 million TON from the TF Reserve\n\n-   Publicly announcing their fund in Toncoin channels\n\nTON Foundation is neutral, but we commend and encourage community initiative. Any community member can propose an initiative, and if it garners enough attention from the community, the Foundation will help distribute their message even further. TBF exemplifies what a decentralized Web3 community is all about. Productive community action toward achieving shared goals.\n\nGiven this information, the question for community vote is this: **Should TON Foundation support the TON Believers Fund to attract large holders and donate 1m Toncoin to the incentives pool?**\n\nPlease vote and let us know your thoughts in the community channels, we are watching and ready to support initiatives and ideas created by the community.\n\n**This vote will run for 7 days from 17/08 until 24/08**",
